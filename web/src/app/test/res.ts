__LLM_RESPONSE__

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence [citation:1][citation:2]. This includes tasks such as recognizing speech, making decisions, and identifying patterns. AI can be categorized into two types: Weak AI and Strong AI. Weak AI, also known as Narrow AI, is AI that is trained and focused to perform specific tasks [citation:3]. Examples of Weak AI include Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, and self-driving vehicles. Strong AI, on the other hand, is AI that can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks [citation:7].

For video resources on AI, there are several available online. A simple search for "Artificial Intelligence videos" yields a variety of results, including tutorials, lectures, and demonstrations [citation:6].
